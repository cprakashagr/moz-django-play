# **Django Rest Framework**

First application for Django and Rest Framework with MongoDB. To enable faster retrieval, `redis` has been used.

A provider is an identity which provides services around a geo-fenced polygon. The userEndPoint is an API which can find the intersection and return the list of providers who can service.

### **Usage**
providers:
```bash
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE `http://localhost:8000/api/providers/`
```

polygons:
```bash
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE at http://localhost:8000/api/polygons/
```

To access endpoints:
```
GET at http://localhost:8000/api/userEndPoint?lnlt=0.5,0.5
```

```

application/json Raw data for Polygons:

                        0
                    ],

                    ],
                    [
                        2,
                        2
                    ],
                    [
                        0,
                        2
                    ],
                    [
                        0,
                        0
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        },
        "providerId": "596635558be4ca35daec9243"
    }
```

##### **TODO**

1. For a new polygon entry, modify redis cache
2. Documentation
